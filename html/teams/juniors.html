						The Castlebar Hockey Club operates a variety of programs for junior players (U8-U18) throughout the year. The club seeks to continue to develop and support programs which are in line with our mission to develop lifelong involvement in field hockey and with the principles of Irish Sport for Life.  The fundamental objectives are to maintain high quality coaching, a variety of programming, personal development experiences and fun though hockey and social connections.  The club also adheres to the True Sport Principles.
					</p>
					<p>
						Field hockey is a late specialization sport and skills are continually developed and advanced in line with cognitive and physical development.  Athletes 14 and under are encouraged to maintain participation in multiple sports.
					</p>
					<p>
						Competitive and advanced skill opportunities are provided through the Junior programs, FHBC programs and integration of Junior-age players into the Senior teams at approximately age 14.  In this context, the Junior Spring Season remains primarily focused on social connections, skill development and fun.  The Junior Spring Season also provides an opportunity for the older junior athletes to participate in coaching, umpiring and other volunteer roles which encourage athletes to give back to the community and sport.
