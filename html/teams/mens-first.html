						The Men's Hockey section provides opportunities for all ages to train and play matches at a level that suits their ability and aspiration. Castlebar Hockey Club supports four teams in the Connaught Hockey League and two veterans teams in the Wessex Masters League. The Men's 1st team compete in Connaught Division 1 and are hoping to climb back into regional leagues in the next few seasons. They are supported by the 2nd team, with our 3rd team acting as a junior development squad. This squad mixes youth and experience to encourage more of the juniors to make the transition to men's hockey. The 2nd team is a more social squad - though they still like to win!

						The men's section has undergone some changes this season that we hope will add strength and depth to the club, encourage further player development and provide opportunities for all. Training has been restructured, and players are encouraged to attend and meet club members from other squads, support one another and enjoy their time at the club - whether playing or socialising. The thriving junior section has seen the standard and style of our younger players improve over recent years, with many now part of the Ireland Hockey single system for player development. We are proud to sustain our own pitch and fantastic adjacent clubhouse - a facility that is the envy of many visitors to the club!
