						Castlebar Hockey Club Mission Statement
					</h3>
					<br>
					As a club we aim to provide access to the game of hockey, at the appropriate level, to as many people as possible within the Castlebar area, regardless of gender, age or background. We aim to provide relevant coaching at all levels, especially at junior and youth level. This allows players to develop to their best potential. 
					<br>
					We will establish effective links with the District Councils, Schools, Active Sports, County Associations and other key organisations to improve skills, increase participations and progress young players to higher levels of achievement. We aim to develop all aspects of the sport, not just playing, but also in umpiring, coaching and on the social side, so that members are made to feel included in and part of a worthwhile club. We have 4 men’s teams playing in the Hampshire league structure and also have 2 men’s Vets teams. We have 5 ladies teams playing in the West Clubs Women’s Hockey league.
					<br>
					<br>
					As a Club we will put in place the necessary administrative structure to encourage all members to become involved in as many ways as possible and to offer access to relevant courses to enable the Club to improve its skills base.
					<br>
					We will endeavour to provide the circumstances in which our members can enjoy the sport of hockey in a safe and structured club environment, to the benefit of the individual, the sport and the local community.
					<br>
					<br>
					We have an ever growing junior section which starts off at minis under 10s then have team boy boys and girls all the way to under 18. We actively encourage our junior members to join our adult teams once old enough. To help them grow in the hockey world and also as a person.
